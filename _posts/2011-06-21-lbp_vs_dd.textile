abstract: >
  Via an oracle experiment, we show that the upper bound on accuracy of a CCG 
  parser is significantly lowered when its search space is pruned using a 
  supertagger, though the supertagger also prunes many bad parses.  Inspired by 
  this analysis, we design a single model with both supertagging and parsing 
  features, rather than separating them into distinct models chained together 
  in a pipeline.  To overcome the resulting increase in complexity, we 
  experiment with both belief propagation and dual decomposition approaches to 
  inference, the first empirical comparison of these algorithms that we are 
  aware of on a structured natural language processing problem.  On CCGbank we 
  achieve a labelled dependency F-measure of 88.8% on gold POS tags, and 
  86.7% on automatic part-of-speeoch tags, the best reported results for this 
  task.
