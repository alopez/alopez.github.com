abstract: >
  Log-linear parsing models are often trained by optimizing 
  likelihood, but we would prefer to optimize for a task-specific metric like F-measure.
  Softmax-margin is a convex objective for such models that minimizes a bound on 
  expected risk for a given loss function, but its naïve application requires the loss 
  to decompose over the predicted structure, which is not true of F-measure.
  We use softmax-margin to optimize a log-linear CCG parser for a variety of loss functions, and
  demonstrate a novel dynamic programming algorithm that enables us to use it with
  F-measure, leading to substantial gains in accuracy on CCGBank.  When we embed our
  loss-trained parser into a larger model that includes supertagging features
  incorporated via belief propagation, we obtain further improvements and achieve 
  a labelled/unlabelled dependency 
  F-measure of 89.1%/93.9%, the best reported result for this task.
