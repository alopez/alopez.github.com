I am a research manager at [Rasa](https://rasa.com), where we are building
the standard infrastructure for conversational AI. Building good 
conversational systems is hard, and the goal of our [research](https://rasa.com/research/)
is to deliver tools that make it easier.

My research interests are broad, and I have worked on many engineering, scientific,
and mathematical problems in natural language processing. You can find my work
in these places:

- Most of my published research papers 
  are on my [ACL Anthology page](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/people/a/adam-lopez/)
  along with accurate metadata curated by hand.
- More papers, including preprints and non-ACL publications,
  are on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=u4sxKZwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) 
  along with inaccurate metadata curated by machine.
- My code is on [github](https://github.com/alopez). 

I am also a [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)) 
at the University of Edinburgh, where I am part of the
[Edinburgh natural language processing group](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/edinburghnlp/).
