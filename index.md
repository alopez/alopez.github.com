I am a researcher in natural language processing. My interests are broad, 
and I have worked on many scientific, mathematical,
and engineering problems related to NLP. 
Most of my research papers can be found on 
the [ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/people/a/adam-lopez/)
and/ or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7KdAmbUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

I have held roles in both academia and industry, as an engineer, scientist, lecturer, and as director of artificial intelligence at a startup.
I am currently a [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)) 
at the University of Edinburgh, where I am part of the 
[Edinburgh natural language processing group](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/edinburghnlp/).
I am privileged to have advised some immensely talented PhD students, who surely taught me more than I taught them:
