I am Director of [AI Research](https://rasa.com/research/) at [Rasa](https://rasa.com), where we are building
the standard infrastructure for conversational AI. 
My research interests are broad, and I have worked on many scientific, mathematical,
and engineering problems in natural language processing. 
Most of my research papers can be found on 
the [ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/people/a/adam-lopez/)
and/ or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Adam-Lopez/144871732?sort=pub-date).

I am also a [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)) 
at the University of Edinburgh, where I am part of the 
[Edinburgh natural language processing group](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/edinburghnlp/).
I am privileged to have worked with some immensely talented PhD students:
