I get so much email that I simply cannot respond to all of it. Even in 
the best of circumstances, any reply is likely to be slow. So here
is a brief guide on whether to email me (if you haven't already), and 
what to expect (if you have).

Do you have a specific question related to my research? 
: Email <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk>, and please also email my coauthors, who
  may be able to reply more quickly. 

Looking to hire me for consulting work or a job?
: Email <alopez.nlproc@gmail.com>. Please be patient waiting for a reponse.

Are you a friend and/ or (former) research student?
: I would love to hear from you! Please email my personal
  address if you have it, otherwise one of the other addresses
  on this page. 
  
Are you a personal tutee in need of advice or support?
: I'll reply as soon as I am able. I can't always reply right away, 
  so please be patient awaiting a response. If you want to book a meeting, you can use
  [this page](https://calendly.com/adamlopez/pt/). (Note: If you are not a PT, 
  please do not book meetings this way; this link is for PTs only and I will cancel
  meetings booked by anyone else through this link).
  
Are you a (former) PhD / MSc / UG thesis student or employee in need of a reference?  
: I would love to help! Please email <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk>, and provide as
  much detail as you can about the position and your application. I'd appreciate as
  much advance notice as you can give me.

Are you a (former) taught student in need of a reference?
: Unless I know you well, the best I'm likely to be able to provide is a brief synopsis
  of your performance in my course(s), which is of limited value for most job
  or PhD applications. If a brief synopsis suffices, I'm of course happy
  to supply it: email <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk>. However, for most job or PhD applications,
  you will be best served by a reference from someone who has worked with you
  closely and knows your work well.

Are you an employer seeking a reference for one of my (former) students or employees?
: Email <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk> with details.

Are you seeking a studentship or other academic position with me?
: I am not currently taking students or hiring
  for academic positions, so please don't email me. I wish
  you the best of luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you,
  so I will not respond to your email.

Are you seeking information about courses or programs at the university?
: Every course that I co-teach has an explicit policy on how to contact
  the organizers, which is listed on the course page in learn. If you 
  are in my course, please follow that policy. If you aren't in the course
  and you aren't sure who to contact, please contact the course organizer
  listed in DPRS or PATH (who might be me, or might be someone else).

Are you interested in other university business? 
: I am unlikely to respond to emails about university business unless I'm
  obliged or already committed.

Are you interested in something not covered by the answers above? 
: It is unlikely that I will respond to emails on other topics. My 
  time is finite, and every email I respond to chips away at the time 
  that I have for the people that matter to me.
