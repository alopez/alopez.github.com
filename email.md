I get so much email that I simply cannot respond to all of it. So here
is a brief guide on whether to email me and how. 

Are you interested in my work at Rasa? 
: Email <a.lopez@rasa.com>. Please
  _do not_ send university-related emails to this address.

Are you a friend or a current or former research student?
:  I would love to hear from you! Please email my personal
  address if you have it, otherwise one of the other addresses
  on this page.

Are you seeking a studentship or other academic position with me?
: I am no longer taking students or hiring
  for academic positions, so please don't email me. I wish
  you the best of luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you,
  so I will not respond to your email.

Are you seeking information about courses or programs at the university?
: I no longer teach nor direct academic 
  programes, so please don't email me. I wish you best of
  luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you, so I will
  not respond to your email.

Are you interested in other university business? 
: My work at the university is limited to advising
  my current PhD students. If your interest relates
  to that, or to another university matter on which I am obliged 
  or already commited, email <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk>. I 
  am unlikely to respond to emails about other university business.
  I also do not check my university email frequently, so please be patient, 
  and _do not_ send university-related emails to 
  other addresses.

Are you interested in something not covered by the answers above? 
: It is unlikely
  that I will respond to emails on other topics. My time is finite, and every email I 
  respond to chips away at the time that I have for the people 
  that matter to me.
