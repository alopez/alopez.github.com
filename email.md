I get so much email that I can't reply to all of it. Even in the best
of circumstances, I often can't reply right away. So here
is a brief guide on whether to email me (if you haven't already), and 
what to expect (if you have).

tl;dr
: 
  - To discuss (hiring me for) research, email <nlpresearch.eloquent365@passfwd.com>.
  - To discuss teaching, admin, or other university business, email <alopez@ed.ac.uk>.
  - To ask for a reference for someone who has worked with me, email <alopez@ed.ac.uk>
  - I don't have bandwidth to answer emails asking for jobs or about university business that doesn't involve me.

Do you have a specific question related to my published research? 
: Email <nlpresearch.eloquent365@passfwd.com>, and please also email my coauthors, who
  may be able to reply more quickly. 

Do you want to hire me for consulting work or a new job?
: Email <nlpresearch.eloquent365@passfwd.com>. Please be patient waiting for a reponse.

Are you a friend and/ or (former) research student?
: I would love to hear from you! Please email my personal
  address if you have it, otherwise one of the other addresses
  on this page. 
  
Are you a (former) PhD / MSc / UG thesis student or employee in need of a reference?  
: I would love to help! Please email <alopez@ed.ac.uk>, and provide as
  much detail as you can about the position and your application. I'd appreciate as
  much advance notice as you can give me.

Are you a (former) taught student in need of a reference?
: Unless I know you well, the best I'm likely to be able to provide is a brief synopsis
  of your performance in my course(s), which is of limited value for most job
  or PhD applications. If a brief synopsis suffices, I'm of course happy
  to supply it: email <alopez@ed.ac.uk>. However, for most job or PhD applications,
  you will be best served by a reference from someone who has worked with you
  closely and knows your work well.

Are you an employer seeking a reference for one of my (former) students or employees?
: I will be happy to provide a reference. Email <alopez@ed.ac.uk> with details.

Are you seeking a studentship or other academic position with me?
: I am not currently taking students or hiring
  for academic positions, so please don't email me. I wish
  you the best of luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you,
  so I will not respond to your email.

Are you seeking information about courses or programmes at the university?
: I am on sabbatical for the academic year 2024-25, so cannot help you 
  with courses or programmes. Please contact the appropriate course organiser
  or programme director.

Are you interested in other university business? 
: I am unlikely to respond to emails about university business unless I'm
  obliged or already committed.

Are you interested in something not covered by the answers above? 
: It is unlikely that I will respond to emails on other topics. My 
  time is finite, and every email I respond to chips away at the time 
  that I have for the people that matter to me.
