I get so much email that I simply cannot respond to all of it. So here
is a brief guide on whether to email me and how. 

Are you interested in my work outside the university?
: Contact me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-lopez-nlp-researcher/).

Are you interested in my academic work with my PhD students? 
: Email <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk>, and please also email the student. 
  I check my university email at most once a week, so please be 
  patient waiting for a response, and _do not_ send university-related 
  emails to any other address.

Are you a friend and/ or a current or former research student?
:  I would love to hear from you! Please email my personal
  address if you have it, otherwise one of the other addresses
  on this page.

Are you seeking a studentship or other academic position with me?
: I am not currently taking students or hiring
  for academic positions, so please don't email me. I wish
  you the best of luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you,
  so I will not respond to your email.

Are you seeking information about courses or programs at the university?
: I not currently teaching nor directing academic 
  programes, so please don't email me. I wish you best of
  luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you, so I will
  not respond to your email.

Are you interested in other university business? 
: My responsibilities at the university are limited to advising my 
  current PhD students. I am unlikely to respond to emails about other 
  university business.

Are you interested in something not covered by the answers above? 
: It is unlikely
  that I will respond to emails on other topics. My time is finite, and every email I 
  respond to chips away at the time that I have for the people 
  that matter to me.
