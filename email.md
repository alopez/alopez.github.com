I get so much email that I simply cannot respond to all of it. So here
is a brief guide on whether to email me and how. **Is your
email...**

**... about my work at Rasa?** 
: Email <a.lopez@rasa.com>. Please
  _do not_ send university-related emails to this address.

**... from a friend and/ or former research student?**
:  I would love to hear from you! Please email my personal
  address if you have it, otherwise one of the other addresses
  on this page.

**... seeking an a studentship or other academic position with me?** 
: I am no longer taking students or hiring
  for academic positions, so please don't email me. I wish
  you the best of luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you,
  so I will not respond to your email.

**... about courses or programs of study at the university?** 
: I no longer teach nor direct academic 
  programes, so please don't email me. I wish you best of
  luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you, so I will
  not respond to your email.

**... about university business?** 
: My work at the university is limited to advising
  my current PhD students. If your email relates
  to that, send it to <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk>. I 
  am unlikely to respond to other emails about university work,
  unless it is something on which I am obliged or already committed.
  Even when I am able to respond, my response may be slow. Please 
  be patient, and do _not_ send university-related emails to 
  other addresses.

**... not in one of the above categories?** 
: It is unlikely
  that I will respond. My time is finite, and every email I 
  respond to chips away at time that I have for people and
  projects that matter to me.
