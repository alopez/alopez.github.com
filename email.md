I get so much email that I simply cannot respond to all of it. So here
is a brief guide on whether to email me and how. **Is your
email about...**

- **... my work at Rasa?** Email <a.lopez@rasa.com>. Please
  do _not_ send university-related emails to this address.
  

- **... a studentship or other academic
  position with me?** I am no longer taking students or hiring
  for academic positions, so please don't email me. I wish
  you the best of luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you,
  so I will not respond to emails about this.

- **... courses or programmes of study
  at the university?** I am no longer involved in any courses
  or programes, so please don't email me. I wish you best of
  luck, but there's nothing I can do to help you, so I will
  not respond to emails about this.

- **... in other academic or university 
  matters?** My work at the university is limited to advising
  my current PhD students, so if you have something related
  to that, email <alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk>. I 
  am unlikely to respond to emails on other academic or 
  university topics. Even for topics on which I am able to 
  respond, my response may be slow. Please be patient, and
  do not send university-related emails to other addresses.

- **... something from a friend or former research student?**
  I would love to hear from you! Please use my personal
  email address if you have it, otherwise one of the addresses
  above.
