  -
    name: Michael Auli
    url: http://michaelauli.github.io/ 
    tagline: PhD 2012. Now at Facebook AI Research.
    description: >
      Michael's <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/7636">thesis</a> 
      applied advanced machine learning techniques to a
      parser for combinatory categorial grammar, a linguistically expressive 
      grammar formalism. It remained state-of-the-art for several years afer he
      developed it. After graduation Michael began working on neural
      translation, and is one of the key researchers behind Facebook's 
      <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1978007565818999/a-novel-approach-to-neural-machine-translation/">convolutional neural machine translation system</a>.

    name: Federico Fancellu
    url: https://ffancellu.github.io/
    tagline: "PhD 2018, co-advised with Bonnie Webber. Now at Samsung AI Center."
    description: >
      Federico's <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/33038">thesis</a> 
      developed state-of-the-art models for computational detection
      of negation in English and Chinese. During his postdoc with Mirella
      Lapata, he collaborated with Sorcha Gilroy on semantic parsing.

    tagline: "PhD 2019. Now at peak.ai."
    description: >
      Sorcha's <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35606">thesis</a>
      surveys a range of mathematical tools for probabilistic generative
      models of graphs, and presents several new results. Among her many
      accomplishments as a PhD student, she won an outstanding paper award
      at NAACL 2018.
  -
    name: Nikolay Bogoychev
    url: https://nbogoychev.com/
    tagline: "PhD 2019. Now postdoc at the University of Edinburgh."
    description: >
      Nikolay's <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35886">thesis</a> shows how careful thinking about memory accesses 
      yields simple and very fast algorithms for machine translation on
      parallel hardware. He is continuing this work as a postdoc in
      the machine translation group at Edinburgh.
  -
    name: Clara Vania
    url: https://claravania.github.io/
    tagline: PhD 2020. Now postdoc at New York University.
    description: >
      Clara's <a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/36742">thesis</a> teases apart the interaction between morphology, typology,
      and character-level neural models, showing where the latter successfully
      mimic the mapping from form to function, and cases where they don't.

    name: Arabella Jane Sinclair
    url: https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.j.sinclair/
    tagline: PhD 2020, co-advised with Dragan Gašević and Chris Lucas.  Now postdoc at University of Amsterdam.
    description: >
      Arabella's <a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/37009">thesis</a> shows that when learning a second language through
      conversation, students and their tutors adapt to each other across
      many different dimensions, and that the nature of this adaptation
      depends on the student's ability in the language.

    name: Sameer Bansal

    tagline: PhD 2020, co-advised with Sharon Goldwater and Herman Kamper. Now researcher at Bloomberg.
    description: >
      Sameer's <a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/36781">thesis</a> pushes the limits of what kind of system it is possible to
      build if you only  have a few hours of speech paired with translations, with
      potential applications in language documentation and crisis response.
