## Tutorial on Probabilistic Graph Formalisms

I helped [Sorcha Gilroy](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sorcha-gilroy-a6105693) 
teach a tutorial on graph grammars and automata,
and their interaction with probability:

* [Materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wmncLdRsY27Av1oNzk7Jaa9xWhxGTPrQ) from our week-long tutorial at NASSLLI 2018.
* [Materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fgqcGZkr_9Bhnla649yR6wSPps8Tu6ND) from our half-day tutorial at EMNLP 2018.

Sorcha's excellent [PhD thesis](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35606)
presents this tutorial material and much more, with extensive narration and 
explanation of the many examples, alongside several novel proofs. I recommend her thesis
to anyone in NLP who wants to learn about probabilistic generative 
models of graphs.
